# Projects
## Network Intrusion Detection with Deep Neural Networks
• Trained DNN models on NSL-KDD and UNSW datasets and classified them with accuracy as high as 77%.
• Implemented JSMA attack, which resulted an accuracy as low as 2%.
• Generated 10k benign, DoS, probe, u2r, and r2l network traffic flows with as high as 98% confidence using GAN.
## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
• Implemented DCGAN paper and trained generator and discriminator for SVHN, MNIST, and CelebA datasets.
• Tuned the model’s sensitive hyperparameters such that the generator and discriminator don’t overpower each other.
• Generated handwritten digits and Google’s street view house numbers indistinguishable from the real dataset.
## Adversarial Machine Learning for Traffic Sign Classification
• Built a convolutional neural network for traffic sign classification model resulting an accuracy of 99%.
• Implemented FGS and JSMA adversarial attacks on the CNN model, which resulted an accuracy as low as 1%.
## Design and Optimization of Nurse Scheduling Problem
• Created the simplest mini-MySQL relational database management system in C.
• Developed a scheduler of employees for hospital departments based on customer’s requirements with a team of 3.
